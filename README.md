This code is for a project with the GW Viscog Lab using a T's and L's search task with a foveation mask.

The foveation mask is meant to partially obscure stimuli. 
It is accompanied by a spotlight of sorts: a radius around the cursor that cuts through the mask, revealing the items below it.

If the code looks dumb and stupid and bad, it's because it is.

My next steps will be:
  (1) Adding instructions for reporting targets and no-target trials,
  (2) Requiring participants to center cursor between trials,
  (3) Set a min. time between trials (Spamming the spacebar kinda breaks everything),
  (4) Possibly a slider for opacity?, and
  (5) Maybe making the L's offset a bit to vary distractor similarity to target?
